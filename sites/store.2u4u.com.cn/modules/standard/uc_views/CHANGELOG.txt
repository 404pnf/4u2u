uc_views 6.x-2.0
================

IMPORTANT:
This release breaks backwards compatibility with uc_views 1.x. If you have any views containing Ubercart order fields
they might not work after installing this version! The reason for this is that orders are now a base table and no longer joins
with nodes through order products.

 o Bugfixes
 o Features
   - Applied pathch from sammys that adds the following
       * Adds orders to views as a base table. This means you can base your views on orders instead of on products.
       * Allows orders to join up to the user that ordered.
       * Displays all order fields from the uc_orders table.
       * Can optionally link the order ID to the order admin screen.
       * Can have order id as an argument.
       * Can show all country and zone fields (e.g two letter country codes).
       * Adds primary_email field and render it as a mailto: link
       * Uses field descriptions from the schema subsystem to reduce developer efforts in future.

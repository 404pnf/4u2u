Node Limit Number v2.0-dev

DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module allows for the creation of rules that limit the creation of content
on a site. The 1.0 version of this module is a direct port of the Drupal 5
version and has its own UI and database table. It worked quite well, but when 
tied to together with the Rules module this module allows for nearly any kind
of special conditions. The 2.0 branch of this module is a complete rewrite 
allowing it to integrate with Rules. Instead of creating limits you create 
rules using the special event and the special condition.

INSTALL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must have downloaded and installed the Rules module first.

1. Download the latest release from drupal.org/project/node_limitnumber.
2. Extract the files.
3. Put the files into your modules folder for your drupal site.
4. Enable the module at admin/build/modules.
5. Start making your rules.

USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One example rule have been provided. This rule can be modified with whatever
conditions and actions you need to enforce your limit. The only requirement is 
that you must include the special limit condition and it must also use the 
special event that it is already set to.

When modifying the rules to create your own limits the possibilities are 
endless. Limits can be set per role, per user, with time limits, per node types.
The rule can then be enabled or disabled as needed.

CONFLICTING LIMITS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Be careful during the creation of your rules so that you do not create conflicting
limits because the lowest limit will always take precedence. Example:
Role A can create 1 example node
Role B can create 2 example nodes
User Z has role A and B
User Z can only create 1 example node
 
GETTING HELP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you need some help creating a rule you can post a support request in the
issue queue, but you would get better help if you posted in the forums. I will
try to help as much as I can but it can be very hard to create a rule without
knowing all of the information. Please be very descriptive about your needs and
I will respond to any support requests in a timely manner. Support requests will
be closed after 2 weeks of inactivity.

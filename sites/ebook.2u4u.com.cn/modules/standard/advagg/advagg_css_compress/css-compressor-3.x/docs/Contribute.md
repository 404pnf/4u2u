==========

This project is always in dire need of help in any form, I only have 2 rules:

- All sandboxed tests must pass.

For nix users: From the root directory, run 'make test'
For windows users: Run 'php unit/start.inc'

- Tab character indentations

I don't care if you like 2,3,4,8,16 spaced indentation, just make sure it's a tab character and not spaces.


make test
---------

This command will run all sandboxed tests to check that most functions run the way they should.


make test-focus
---------------

This command runs a focused test on a single function for development. Open up unit/focus.inc for configuration.


make test-file
--------------

This command runs a focused test on a single file. Make sure the original resides in unit/sheets/original/ and the expected
output resides in unit/sheets/expected/. Open up unit/file.inc for configuration


make test-all
-------------

This command runs all sandboxed tests, as well as double compressions on any stylesheets in benchmark src. Doesn't always pass,
but is a helpful check to see that most compression is done the first time around.


make test-regression [ VERSION=temp ]
--------------------------------

The regression command takes an optional assignment which will do testing against the given version. Defaults is to the last run test.


make benchmark
--------------

This command runs the benchmark process. This will create a new temp directory for regression testing and comparison.


make clean
----------

This command removes all generated files used for comparisons and benchmarks.


unit/sandbox/
-------------

The sandbox directory contains json files for focused tests used in unit testing.

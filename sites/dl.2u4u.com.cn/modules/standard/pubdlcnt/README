Introduction
============

Public Download Count is a module that keeps track of file download count.  Unlike Download Count module, this module is designed to work with Drupal's public file system. This module converts file URL in the any valid HTML anchor tags on the fly to use the external PHP program included in this module directory to keep track of file downloads. The target files are not necessary to be located under Drupal's installation directory but anywhere including external servers too.

If you want to protect your files in more secure way, or if you do not have any strong reasons that you need to use the public file system, I recommend that you use the Drupal's private file system and the Download Count module which is desined to work with private file system. This module is intended for the following people:

1. Those who needs to use the public file system for some reasons, and yet want to keep track of file download count.
2. Those who want to keep track of download count of the files on different servers.
3. Those who use private file system and still want to keep track of download count of direct links to some files.

The goal of this module is to add simple file download count tracking capability just like using CGI file download counter program with ease. Therefore, controlling file download itself (access restrictions by user role, or limit the number of downloads by the same user, etc) is something that this module would not be meant to do.

This module does not modify the node data when it's stored to the database. Instead, it converts node data on the fly right before it is displayed. Therefore, you can enabling/disabling this module at any time without hurting the node data.

This module works with anchor tags that satisfies the following criterias.

 1. The anchor tag must have a URL with a file name at its end. It does not work with the anchor tags that end with directory name or slash (/) character.

 2. The anchor tag must not have any query string. For example, following anchor tag is ignored by this module. <a href="http://myserver.com/path/program.php?param1=XXXXX&param2=YYYYY>

 3. The anchor tag must not have 'rel=lightbox...' attribute which means that it is the anchor to an image to be handled by the lightbox module to avoid the conflict problem with the lightbox module. (thickbox and shadowbox too)

 4. The anchor tag must have a file name with a valid file name extension. Valid file name extesions can be customized at the module's configuration page. 

 5. The anchor tag must not have a file path to the private file system (which includes /system/files in its path).

 6. The anchor tag must be in nodes, not in comments. This module does not handle anchor tags in comments.


How it works
============
This module keep track of file downloading operation and records the download count for each file on daily basis. So you can see the stastics of download count for each file by daily, monthly or even yearly later. Currently, it does not limit the number of records to be kept. Technically speaking, it stores 1 record per each file on the day when the file is downloaded. Therefore 365 records are created per year for a file at maximum. I guess if it's not for a mass production sites that focus on file downloading, it would be OK with this kind of number of incresing records.

When you install and enable this module, this module adds two pages, one under site configuration and the other one under report section of administer site.

The report page of this module shows the summary of download count for all the files and you can see the summary of each file in a separate page. You can also download the counter data as a tab separated text file using the Export feature of this module.

The settings page of this module let you specify the extension of the file name you want to keep track of.

NOTE: File download counter is incremented even if the downloading is aborted/cancelled in the middle. The counter is not increment if the file does not exists.


Known issue
===========
As I explained earlier, this module does not work well with the anchor tag of image files handled by the lightbox module. Therefore, this module does not count the image files handled by lightbox even when .jpg, .png, .gif extensions are included to the valid extensions. (thickbox and shadowbox too). I think this would be OK since these anchor is used for displaying images instead of downloading image file.

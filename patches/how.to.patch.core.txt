apply patch to drupal core
ref:  http://drupal.org/patch/apply

Provided that the patch was made relative to the root directory of the
concerned project, navigate to the that directory (using cd). For a patch on
Drupal, that will be the Drupal directory; for a contrib module or theme, that
is the root directory of the project. Once there, issue the command:


	patch -p0 < path/file.patch

If the patch was not made relative to the project's root directory, you can
place the patch in the same directory as the file being patched and run the
patch command without the -p option. To do so, cd to the directory and type:

	patch < file.patch


REVERSE A PATCH
You can reverse a patch if you have finished testing it, or if you want to see
whether a problem has been introduced by a particular patch. You should also
reverse a patch prior to adding a newer, updated version of the same patch. To
reverse the patch, use the patch command with the -R option:


      	patch -p0 -R < path/file.patch

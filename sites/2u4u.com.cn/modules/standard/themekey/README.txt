Description
===========

ThemeKey is designed to be a generic theme switching module. It
allows you to switch the theme for different paths and based
on object properties (e.g. node field values). It can also be
easily extended to support additional paths or properties, as
exposed by other modules.

Documentation for users and developers is very sparse at the
moment. I hope to complete the docs in the next few weeks.
Thanks for your patience :)


Installation
============

1. Place the entire themekey folder into your Drupal modules/ or better
   sites/x/modules/ directory.

2. Enable the themekey module by navigating to
     administer > modules

3. Bring up the themekey configuration screens by navigating to
     administer > settings > themekey

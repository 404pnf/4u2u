CHANGELOG for the uc_affiliate2 module

Version 2.5
*************
2009/05/13
-- disabled the "Upline" page by default (you can enable it in Settings if you want)
-- removed subdomain support (see drupal.org/project/domain for the right way to do this)
-- the cookie tracking settings are now general, no longer per role
-- removed the "switch after" setting for cookied roles. It was unused and confusing.

-- functionality for admin's to appy/remove commission from an order.
-- separate tab to view the commissions on an order (with functionality to edit or remove specific commission)
-- add optional feature to allow subsequent orders for a member to credit the commissions back to the previous affiliate.
-- add CA support [trigger: commission_applied], [conditions: has_affiliate, check_commission, check_level], [actions: override_commission, send_affiliate_email]
-- add token support for the affiliate email
-- add 'level' field to the commission table
-- add an advanced rule based product commissions options for defining commission structures
-- support fixed commissions as well as percentage

-- separate the code for applying the commissions from the hook_order() function
-- split functionality from *.module to a *.user.inc and *.admin.inc files
-- separate affiliate settings page into 3 tabs for banners, commissions and settings.

-- fixed reporting so that users in different timezone will all see the same result
-- optimized the affiliate/links page. Added pagination to the HTML export.
-- many small fixes

Version 2.5rc1
**************
-- translation updates (some strings weren't translatable)
-- Reimplemented the uc_affiliate2_clicks function. 
-- updated the commission removal routines, we don't try to remove commissions that aren't there anymore :)
-- simplified the admin_users form code ( for amounts paid to the affiliate). Thanks to freakalis for the tip
-- we are now compatible with PostgreSQL. Thanks to Chris (cjscullyca) for his query fixes.
-- fixes to the code we use to generate timestamps and get records from the db. Should be problem free now.
-- the affiliate url now uses user id's instead of names. Old urls still supported, of course. Thanks to lonehorseend.
-- add support for customizable affiliate URL schemes (by jjeff)
-- use prices with VAT / taxes. Thanks to kenwen/longwave
-- support for disabling commission for certain payment methods (which means we work with uc_free_order in the mix).
-- added support for "ignoring" a product (exclude from generated links, calculated commission) by setting it's commission to 0.
-- fix for "affiliate code generation user issue" (allow generating links for users other than the current one)
-- fixed error in Downline when ordering by Level (disabled, not possible for now)
-- fixed error in admin/store/manage (remove option to sort by clicks, users, orders, not possible for now)

Version 2.0
***********
2009/05/06
Rewrites & cleanups all over the place.
-- port to drupal6/ubercart2.
-- rewrote menu code.
-- rewrote code that used tapir to use the drupal table api.
-- rewrote the dashboard code (counters were incorrect, code was ugly)
-- new date&time handling code, fixes issues on some configurations.
-- removed old timezone handling code. Handling it the drupal way.
-- reworked the monthly_report admin_users functions. They were ugly & slow (N+1 queries problem)
-- you can now select multiple statuses for which to award commissions.
-- cancelling an order ( or changing from an "award" status) will now remove the commission.
-- removed the counts table, running live queries now. Less bug-prone.
-- added the "all orders" tab to the affiliate dashboard. Shows all orders by status created with the affiliate's id.
-- added a more detailed unique clicks view, displaying user ip, if the cookie was set, etc.
-- many bugfixes and smaller changes.
